# rgb-ascii-art

This is part of my learning process with Python :)

Initially created `HexToAnsiColors.py` to convert a hex color coded ascii banner created with http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ and coloured with http://patorjk.com/text-color-fader/

The output will be something you can colorfully print in you terminal.

Then I decided to go with my own color transition algorithm so I created `ColorizeAscii.py` which basically also receives an ascii banner but no need to use the online color fader.

Next, I create `WelcomeMessage.py` which is now the welcome of my shell sessions

Next thing I want to do is polishing some edges and try generating the text ascii banners within my script instead of using the `taag` online app. Maybe something such as https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art will do the trick.
