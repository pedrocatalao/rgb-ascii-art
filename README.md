# rgb-ascii-art

For now this will pick an Ascii file generated with http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ and coloured with http://patorjk.com/text-color-fader/ and output as a terminal friendly txt file coloured with ANSI escape codes.

Next step is to use something such as https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art to generate the Ascii and then generate the colour transitions in one go.
